📌 NOTES FOR TEAM — PLEASE READ

This file (admin_panel/tests.py) is where we would normally write automated tests 
to make sure the admin_panel works correctly after changes.  

🔹 What this file does:
- Django looks here when running `python manage.py test`.
- Ensures that code in admin_panel does not break unexpectedly.

🔹 What you should NOT do:
- Don’t delete this file. Django expects it to exist.
- Don’t worry if it’s empty for now — tests are optional for our current project scope.

🔹 How you should FEEL about this file:
Think of it as a safety net that we might use later.  
Right now, it’s harmless and invisible. 🙂
