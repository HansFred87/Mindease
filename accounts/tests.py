📌 NOTES FOR TEAM — PLEASE READ

This file (accounts/tests.py) is where we can write automated tests for the accounts app.

🔹 What this file does:
- Helps verify that our code works as expected.
- Currently empty because we haven’t written any tests yet.

🔹 What you should NOT do:
- Don’t delete this file; Django expects it in every app.
- Don’t put models, views, or admin code here; this is only for tests.

🔹 How you should FEEL about this file:
Think of it as a “safety net” for the accounts app. Even if empty, it ensures we can add tests later and avoid breaking things unknowingly. 🙂
